## Overview

## My process

```markdown
1. Building up semantic HTML

- setting up text elements and image element
- Allocating classes to html elements to control them using CSS

2. Setting up CSS

- set background color and font styles
- set white box position
- set image and contents
- adjust values (preferance : rem units)
```

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have practised positioning and remembered that using height property as it can mess up responsiveness.

### Continued development

Would like to try out adding javaScript to this and make it an interactive webpage.
